Section B02: "Mining Privacy Designs in the News" - Haojian Jin

Make sure you’ve familarized yourself with the Quarter 2 Project Proposal specifications before proceeding!

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we have covered has been finding ways to generalize trends in privacy, as well as map user privacy preferences from one online service to another. I think that this is the topic that best grounded our project in something practical, that people might actually want to use.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would want to investigate the impact of privacy laws on privacy policies, as well as service design. Specifically, I want to analyze new service creation and how it is affected by different regulations.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One change I would make would be starting work on how to collect privacy designs in websites from earlier years or previous versions. I think that we will eventually start collecting this data and then be able to chart trends in privacy over time.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interesting in word embedding to find privacy settings that are worded differently, but do the same thing. The issue here is that we may not have enough training data to accomplish this.
